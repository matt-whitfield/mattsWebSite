  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't like something you've built?",
    answer: "We'll fix it. I include reasonable revisions in all projects, and I'd rather spend time getting it right than launching something you're not excited about. Clear communication upfront prevents most issues."

    question: "What happens after the website launches?",
