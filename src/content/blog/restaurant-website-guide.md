Restaurant websites have unique challenges. Hungry customers want information fast, and if they can't find what they need in seconds, they'll go somewhere else. After building dozens of restaurant sites, here's what actually matters.

## The Essential Information (Above the Fold)

Visitors need these four things immediately:

1. **Location and hours** - Can I get there? Are you open?
2. **Phone number** - Can I call for reservations or takeout?
3. **Menu** - What do you serve? How much does it cost?
4. **Type of restaurant** - Fast casual? Fine dining? Food truck?

Everything else is secondary.

## Menu Strategy

Your menu is the heart of your website:

### Digital-First Design

- **Make it readable** on phones - most people browse menus on mobile
- **Include prices** - hiding prices creates distrust
- **Organize logically** - appetizers, mains, desserts, drinks
- **Keep it current** - nothing worse than ordering something that's no longer available

### PDF Menus: Just Say No

PDF menus on mobile are terrible:

- Hard to read and navigate
- Don't work well with screen readers
- Poor for SEO
- Difficult to update

Build your menu into the website instead.

## Location and Contact Information

Make it ridiculously easy to find you:

- **Address** should be clickable (opens maps)
- **Phone number** should be clickable (starts call)
- **Hours** should be prominently displayed
- **Parking information** helps customers plan visits

## Online Ordering Integration

If you offer takeout or delivery:

- **Link to your ordering platform** prominently
- **Show delivery radius** if applicable
- **Display estimated wait times** when possible
- **Consider** building ordering into your site vs. third-party platforms

## What NOT to Include

Common restaurant website mistakes:

### Auto-Playing Music

Never, ever auto-play music or sounds. It's 2025.

### Excessive Animations

Your site should load fast. Heavy animations slow things down and distract from important information.

### Complicated Navigation

Keep it simple:
- Home
- Menu
- Location/Hours
- Contact
- (Optional: About, Events, Catering)

### Stock Photos of Generic Food

Use real photos of your actual food, or no food photos at all. Stock photos of pasta don't represent your pasta.

## Photos That Work

Good restaurant photography:

- **Shows your actual food** - not stock images
- **Includes the atmosphere** - dining room, bar, kitchen
- **Features your staff** - builds personal connection
- **Captures the experience** - what's it like to eat here?

## Accessibility Matters

Make your site usable for everyone:

- **Large, readable fonts** - especially for menus
- **Good color contrast** - readable in various lighting
- **Keyboard navigation** - not everyone uses a mouse
- **Screen reader friendly** - proper headings and alt text

## SEO for Restaurants

Help people find you:

- **Include your city/neighborhood** in page titles
- **List your cuisine type** clearly
- **Mention nearby landmarks** in content
- **Keep Google My Business updated**

## Mobile-First Approach

Most restaurant website visits happen on phones:

- **Test everything on mobile** first
- **Make buttons finger-friendly** (44px minimum)
- **Optimize images** for faster loading
- **Simplify navigation** for small screens

## Technology Considerations

Keep it simple:

- **Fast hosting** - every second counts
- **SSL certificate** - builds trust and helps SEO
- **Content management** - you need to update menus and hours
- **Backup system** - don't lose your content

## Special Features Worth Considering

Depending on your restaurant type:

### Reservations

- **Online booking** if you take reservations
- **Clear policies** about party size, timing, cancellations
- **Alternative contact** for special requests

### Events and Catering

- **Separate pages** for private events and catering
- **Contact forms** for inquiries
- **Gallery** of past events

### Gift Cards

- **Online sales** if you offer gift cards
- **Clear redemption** instructions
- **Balance checking** system

## Common Technical Mistakes

Avoid these issues:

- **Broken links** to ordering platforms
- **Outdated hours** for holidays
- **Missing mobile optimization**
- **Slow loading images**
- **Complicated contact forms**

## Measuring Success

Track what matters:

- **Phone calls** from the website
- **Direction requests** to your location
- **Online ordering** conversions
- **Reservation** bookings

## Conclusion

Restaurant websites should be tools that drive business, not digital brochures. Focus on making it easy for hungry customers to choose you, find you, and order from you.

The best restaurant website is one that gets out of the way and lets your food and service speak for themselves. Everything else is just noise.

Remember: your website should work as hard as your kitchen staff to bring in customers.
