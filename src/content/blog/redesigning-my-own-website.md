They say the cobbler's children have no shoes, and for web designers, it's often true that our own websites get neglected. After putting off my own redesign for way too long, I finally committed to rebuilding my site from scratch. The process taught me valuable lessons that I now apply to every client project.

## The Procrastination Problem

Why do we put off our own websites? For me, it was a combination of:

- **Perfectionism** - My site had to be "perfect" before launching
- **Lack of clarity** - I wasn't sure what story I wanted to tell
- **Time constraints** - Client work always took priority
- **Decision paralysis** - Too many options led to no decisions

Sound familiar?

## Starting with Strategy

This time, I approached my site like a client project:

- **Defined clear goals** - What did I want the site to achieve?
- **Identified my audience** - Who was I trying to reach?
- **Audited competitors** - What were other designers doing?
- **Created user personas** - How do potential clients research designers?

This strategic foundation made every other decision easier.

## Design Decisions That Matter

### Choosing a Style Direction

I struggled between "safe professional" and "bold creative." I ultimately chose bold because:

- It differentiates me from other designers
- It shows personality and creativity
- It attracts the kind of clients I want to work with

### Content Strategy

Instead of writing about myself, I focused on:

- **Client benefits** - How I solve business problems
- **Process transparency** - What it's like to work with me
- **Real results** - Case studies with actual outcomes

## Technical Choices

I rebuilt using Astro (which became the topic of another blog post) because:

- Performance was a priority
- I wanted to showcase technical skills
- It aligned with my client work approach

## What Changed in My Client Process

This experience improved how I work with clients:

### 1. Better Discovery Questions

Having struggled with my own messaging, I now ask clients:

- "What makes you different from competitors?"
- "What do you want visitors to think when they leave your site?"
- "What's the one thing you want people to remember?"

### 2. Managing Perfectionism

I learned to embrace "good enough to launch" and plan for iteration. I now help clients understand that:

- Version 1.0 doesn't have to be perfect
- Real user feedback is more valuable than internal opinions
- Websites should evolve with businesses

### 3. Content-First Approach

Writing my own content was harder than designing. Now I:

- Start every project with content strategy
- Help clients understand the value of professional copywriting
- Build wireframes around actual content, not placeholder text

## The Results

My new site:

- Generates more qualified leads
- Better represents my personality and approach
- Makes client conversations easier
- Gives me confidence in presentations

## Lessons for Other Designers

If you're putting off your own redesign:

1. **Treat it like a client project** - Follow your own process
2. **Set a deadline** - Perfectionism kills progress
3. **Start with strategy** - Design follows content and goals
4. **Show your personality** - Boring doesn't book projects
5. **Plan for iteration** - Launch and improve based on real feedback

## The Ongoing Process

Here's what I learned about maintenance:

- **Regular content updates** keep the site fresh
- **Analytics review** helps understand what's working
- **Client feedback** reveals gaps in information
- **Industry changes** require strategy updates

## Advice for Small Business Owners

This experience reinforced why websites matter for businesses:

- Your site works 24/7 to represent your business
- First impressions happen in seconds
- Clear messaging beats clever copy
- Professional design builds trust

## Conclusion

Redesigning my own website was humbling, educational, and ultimately transformative for both my business and my client work. The process reminded me why good web design is both an art and a science - and why businesses should invest in getting it right.

If you're a designer reading this, stop making excuses and redesign your site. If you're a business owner, understand that your website is one of your most important business tools. Either way, the investment in getting it right pays dividends.

Sometimes you have to be your own worst client to become a better designer.
