Typography is one of the most powerful yet underutilized tools in web design. While choosing colors and layouts often gets the spotlight, the fonts you select and how you use them can make or break your website's professional appearance.

## 1. Establish a Clear Hierarchy

Your website should guide visitors through content in a logical order. Use font sizes, weights, and spacing to create a clear visual hierarchy:

- **Headlines** should be bold and larger
- **Subheadings** should be medium-sized and distinct
- **Body text** should be easily readable at 16px or larger
- **Captions** can be smaller but still legible

## 2. Limit Your Font Choices

One of the biggest mistakes I see is using too many different fonts. Stick to 2-3 font families maximum:

- One for headings
- One for body text
- Optionally, one accent font for special elements

## 3. Pay Attention to Line Height and Spacing

Proper spacing makes your content easier to read:

- Use 1.4-1.6 line height for body text
- Add generous margins between sections
- Don't cram text together

## 4. Consider Your Audience and Brand

Your typography should reflect your brand personality:

- **Tech companies** might use modern, clean sans-serif fonts
- **Law firms** might prefer traditional serif fonts
- **Creative agencies** can experiment with more unique typefaces

## 5. Test on Different Devices

What looks great on your desktop might be hard to read on mobile:

- Test your typography on various screen sizes
- Ensure text remains legible when scaled
- Consider how fonts render on different operating systems

## Conclusion

Good typography doesn't have to be complicated. By following these five principles, you'll create a more professional, readable, and engaging website that serves your visitors better and reflects positively on your brand.

Remember: your website's typography is working 24/7 to communicate your professionalism. Make sure it's saying the right things about your business.
