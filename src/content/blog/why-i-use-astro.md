After building dozens of websites with various frameworks and tools, I've found my sweet spot for most small business projects: Astro. While it might not be the right choice for every project, it hits the perfect balance of developer experience, performance, and client needs for the majority of my work.

## What Makes Astro Special

Astro takes a unique approach to web development. Instead of shipping JavaScript by default, it renders everything to static HTML and only adds JavaScript when you specifically need it. This "islands architecture" means faster loading times and better SEO out of the box.

### Performance Benefits

- **Faster load times** - No unnecessary JavaScript means pages load instantly
- **Better SEO** - Search engines can easily crawl static HTML
- **Improved Core Web Vitals** - Lighthouse scores consistently in the 90s

## Perfect for Small Business Needs

Most small business websites don't need complex interactivity. They need:

- Fast loading pages
- Good SEO
- Easy content management
- Reliable hosting

Astro excels at all of these requirements.

## When I Don't Use Astro

Astro isn't always the answer. I'll choose different tools when clients need:

- **Complex user dashboards** - React or Vue apps work better
- **Real-time features** - Next.js with serverless functions
- **E-commerce with inventory management** - Shopify or WooCommerce

## The Developer Experience

Working with Astro feels familiar if you know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The component syntax is clean, and the build process is straightforward. Plus, you can still use React, Vue, or Svelte components when needed.

## Client Benefits

My clients love the results:

- Websites load instantly
- Google rankings improve
- Hosting costs are low (static sites are cheap to host)
- Sites are secure (no server-side vulnerabilities)

## Getting Started

If you're considering Astro for your next project, start with their excellent documentation and tutorial. The learning curve is gentle, especially if you're already comfortable with modern web development.

## Conclusion

Astro has become my default choice for small business websites because it delivers exactly what clients need: fast, secure, SEO-friendly sites that don't break the bank to host or maintain. It's not the flashiest framework, but it gets the job done exceptionally well.

For most small businesses, that's exactly what they need.
