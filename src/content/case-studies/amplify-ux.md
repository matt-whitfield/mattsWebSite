challenge: "Job seekers face mental health challenges due to a complex and stressful job search process. The current networking and job search tools often feel artificial and negatively impact mental wellbeing."
goals:
  - Design and test a proof of concept that prioritizes mental wellbeing features
  - Navigate product ambiguity and establish clear direction
  - Lead cross-functional collaboration across 30+ team members
  - Conduct market analysis and competitive research
  - Validate product-market fit through user testing
solution: "Led a 10-week product discovery phase focusing on high-risk, novel features backed by positive psychology research. Developed two core features: Community Letters (inspired by random acts of kindness) and Social Connections (digital water cooler experience) to boost user satisfaction and engagement."

## Key Learnings

### Navigating Ambiguity
Facing uncertainty, I took the lead and collaborated with key stakeholders to gain their buy-in. By making baseline assumptions, I focused our team's direction and narrowed our scope to a testable proof-of-concept. Working with the Project Management Team, we developed OKRs (outcomes, key results) for the project phase to ensure tangible progress during each sprint.

### Prioritizing High-Risk/High-Value Features
Because the product space for job-seekers is well defined and highly competitive, we prioritized two high-risk, novel features that catered to our niche users. These features were driven by the hypothesis: *"We believe that interactions backed by research in positive psychology can create feelings of positivity in the user and lead to increased user engagement/involvement."*

### Working in Parallel to Boost Velocity
Initial sprint goals guided team efforts toward delivering on the POC while defining our target user more clearly. Simultaneously, my team conducted in-depth competitive analysis and market research. This parallel approach allowed us to accomplish two crucial goals: setting a well-informed path forward and gaining valuable insights into our target market.

## Market Research Findings

Research results based on interviews and surveys revealed that mental health is not a primary concern for job seekers, indicating low demand for mental wellbeing tools. However, research did uncover a demand for better, more authentic, professional networking tools. The market demand for browser tools aimed at simplifying content and improving productivity offers a unique opportunity in the wellbeing space.

## Test Results & Insights

- **Social Connections:** Users desired 1:1 connections and real-time interactions, with 90% finding the concept appealing
- **Community Letters:** 80% of users did not see the value, with active users preferring 1:1 chats and passive users hesitant to engage

While the testing scenarios were imperfect and led to some user confusion regarding the community letters feature, the overall findings support that this feature is not worth pursuing at this time. Social Connections, however, uncovered a unique user pain point: current networking platforms are frustrating, and a professional networking tool that promotes more meaningful – and immediate – interactions would have a strong market for early-career tech job-seekers.
