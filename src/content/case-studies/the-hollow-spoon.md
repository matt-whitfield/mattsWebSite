challenge: "The Hollow Spoon had a strong local following but an outdated website with no mobile optimization and a hard-to-read PDF menu. Online reviews were solid, but new visitors weren't converting into reservations."
goals:
  - Mobile-first design that reflects the restaurant's cozy, rustic brand
  - Easy-to-update daily menu system
  - Integrate Google Maps + Google Business
  - Include prominent hours, location, and reservation call-to-actions
solution: "We designed a simple but elegant site with a hero video of the restaurant, embedded Google Maps, and large, tappable buttons for menu, reservations, and directions. A custom CMS setup lets the staff update their menu from their phone."
