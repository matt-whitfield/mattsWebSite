challenge: "Morning Light Coffee, a boutique coffee shop with two locations, was losing business to larger chains with established mobile ordering. Their existing website was beautiful but purely informational, with no way for customers to order ahead or find location-specific information."
goals: 
  - Implement mobile ordering for pickup and delivery
  - Create a digital loyalty program to compete with chains
  - Showcase the shop's locally-sourced beans and artisanal approach
  - Improve location information with specific hours and offerings
solution: "We designed a mobile-first website with integrated online ordering that highlights the shop's artisanal approach. High-quality photography and a minimalist design reflect the brand's aesthetic, while a custom-built ordering system allows for beverage customizations and store-specific menus."
