## Research & Discovery

### The Who and the What
To empathize with users and define high-value pain points, I conducted interviews with restaurant managers, owners, and front of house employees. After creating user-journey maps, personas, and user needs analysis, two critical needs emerged:

1. **Need 1:** A user-friendly tableside ordering system that allows servers to easily take accurate orders during shifts
2. **Need 2:** Improve server ability to accurately and confidently assist guests that have food allergy requirements

### User Journey Insights
Through user journey mapping and persona development, I discovered that restaurant staff need systems that are flexible and don't slow them down during busy service periods. The research revealed that running out of menu items mid-service is frustrating, but not knowing about it and having to return to customers with bad news adds insult to injury.

## Design Challenges & Solutions

### Keep Cool, Keep Customers
Running out of items during service impacts both customer experience and server tips, while affecting long-term customer value for restaurants. The key question became: "How do I help solve this communication breakdown?"

**Design Solutions:**
- **Gluten-Free Checks:** Made it easy for servers to verify if items contain specific ingredients, simplifying allergy checks during busy service
- **Search Functionality:** Early wireframes focused on finding specific items with easily accessible search features
- **Daily Specials Dashboard:** Strong visual hierarchy provides fast access to daily specials and live updates of out-of-stock items

### User Testing Insights
Table-side ordering presents unique challenges for servers who must navigate complex UI while engaging with customers. Testing revealed surprising insights:

- While search functionality would be useful in some cases, most participants preferred using "categories" buttons to find items
- Time constraints during busy service were a major concern
- The system needed to be intuitive enough to use without extensive training

## Key Learnings

### Scope Management Challenge
This project taught valuable lessons about scope management and product requirements. Juggling user interviews, design testing, and feedback iteration for multiple features simultaneously was like "running down a hallway of treadmills, bouncing from one to the next, each running at a different speed."

**What I Learned:**
- The importance of narrowing focus early in the design process
- Value of solid product requirements and user stories
- Need for clear acceptance criteria before beginning design work
- How to balance multiple feature development streams effectively

### User Feedback Impact
User testing provided critical insights that shaped the final design direction. The feedback revealed that while innovative features were appreciated, practical usability during high-stress service periods was the primary concern for restaurant staff.
